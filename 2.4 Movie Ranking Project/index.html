 <h1> Nate's Best Movies</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 favorite movies</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>The most impactful quality of the movie is the score. The music tied in so well with the scences 
        they are set, in that it adds much more suspense to it.    
    </p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
    <p>I was exposed to this cult classic in high school and it has always been a go to for me. Quentin Tarantino
        is one of the most excellent writers within the past several generations in my opinion.
    </p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>I used to not care for anime or anime movies. The only one I really loved as a child was Spirited Away on VHS. When I became a parent, 
        I entered my anime phase and discovered the world of Studio Ghibli. It's hard to pick a favorite but when I hear Studio Ghibli.
        I immediately think of Spirited Away.
